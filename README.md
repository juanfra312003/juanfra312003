# Hi everyone, my name is Juan Francisco Ramírez 👨‍💻
- 📘 I'm currently studying Systems Engineering and Data Science at Ponticia Universidad Javeriana (Bogotá, Colombia).
- 🖥 I've been someone pasionated by learning programming stuff since I was at high school.
- 🏆 My dream is to be a full stack developer in a not fair future, as I told you, I love coding and the constant learning.
- 🥇 I have been member of the ACM chapter of my college since January of 2021. It's a space where I have been actively participating in many activities like an hour of code, Google code Jam and others.
- 🧠 Currently, I am really interested in mobile computing.
